# datalake-ingestion-service

FIXME: Update this README.

Sample service that ingests business events in a data lake.

This service is a sample backoffice service that ingests Lambda events from business services into the raw data tier of a data lake. The Lambda functions in the business services publish their incoming events (that is: the events that trigger their execution) in specific SNS topics. This service chains these SNS topics with Kinesis Firehose delivery streams.

To be done: Transformation of the JSON format of the incoming Lambda events into Parquet.

## Parameters

The AWS SAM template for this serverless application comes with the following individual parameters beyond the standard ones (Stage, LogLevel, etc):

```yaml

## Deployment

This service tries to create IAM roles with individual names. For that, the `sam deploy` command needs to be invoked with the `--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM` option.

## Patterns

Patterns that are applied in this service:

### Integration patterns

- Message exchange: one-way messaging. This service implements the receiver side.
- Message channels: publish-subscribe messaging. This service implements the subscriber side.
- Message channels: topic-stream-chaining. This service chains SNS topics with Kinesis Firehose delivery streams.

### AWS SAM / CloudFormation patterns

- Best practice: tag all resources. This service tags all resources that are taggable.
- Best practice: control log retention. This service controls individual retention time for CloudWatch Logs log streams.
- Cross-service resources: parameter sharing. This acquires details about shared SNS topics and a shared S3 bucket.
